Image Analytics
---------------

Load images from folders and use pre-trained deep network embedding to represent them with a vector of features. 
Then, use Orange's standard arsenal of widgets to cluster or classify the images, or perform any 
kind of feature-based analysis. Use Image Viewer from core Orange to visualize the images.
